    <h4 style="margin-top: 40px">Our story</h4>
    <p>
      Our story begins in 1905 when Grandpa Mihnea Manea was on the largest
      warship of the Russian Potemkin Empire. Hardly enduring the conditions on
      the ship, the entire crew of 750 people rebelled against the regime.
      Consequently, the ports were closed for them and after several failed
      attempts at understanding they were declared traitors by the Russian
      empire, docking in the port of Constanța. Then, Little Romania, the
      country between empires, skillfully demonstrates by its attitude (there
      was no extradition agreement with Russia) that it is a European country,
      accepting refugees (not handing them over to the tsar). Mihnea Manea
      finally arrived on the estate of the boyar Mişu Leopold (Iași) finding
      work as a mechanic at the boyar's mill. He starts a family and stays in
      the lands of Moldova. <br />
      Inheriting the tradition with an imposing reputation in the milling field,
      Petru Manea, in 1924, starting from the small mill, managed to keep up,
      developing in a dynamic rhythm, reaching to own and control several mills
      in Iași County. The relay was taken over in 1994 by Ștefan Manea who
      together with Ivan Siretean supported financially and managerially
      developing what is today Multipan-Bakery.
      <br />The Multipan-Bakery company harmoniously combines quality with
      tradition, offering products made by the local process - with fermented
      mayonnaise - furnished with the best taste.
